Pro Tips
--------

-  You don't need to go to every talk. Look through the schedule of
   events before you arrive or while you are eating or taking a break.
   Figure out which talks you want to see the most. Spread out your time
   between talks, networking, and breaks.

-  Speaking of breaks--conferences are exhilarating, but can also be
   exhausting. Give your brain a break! Grab a quiet spot in the quiet room
   or take a quick walk. Play a board game on your lunch break. Come
   back invigorated.

-  Eat! You can use the energy.

-  Are you looking for a job or is there an opening at your company?
   Check out the job board in ??.

FAQs

.. contents::
   :local:

**Where is everything?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our venue is `Kane Hall on the campus of the University of Washington <https://goo.gl/maps/ZVVnBcmfmN22>`_.

The pre-registration event takes place at TBD.

The main conference takes place at room 130. Refreshments will be available during breaks at the Walker Ames Room (Room 225).

The `sprint <sprint.html>`_ is at The Collective Seattle, `400 Dexter Avenue <https://goo.gl/maps/b1JY354TkvA2>`_.

**How should I get around?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out our `travel guide <travel_guide.html>`_.

**How should I dress?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Seattle is a casual-dress town and so is the PyCascades
   conference. You'll be meeting business colleagues at this conference,
   though, so neat and comfortable are good dress guidelines.

-  This time of year, the
   Pacific Northwest tends to be muddy or raining with occasional swaths
   of blue skies. Layering is usually the way to go.

**What's the weather like?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The weather in February in Seattle is usually cold, but normally above 
freezing. You should expect grey days with light rain. On February 23,
the temperature in Seattle typically ranges from 41°F to 50°F (5°C to
10°C) and is rarely below 32°F (0°C) or above 58°F (14°C).


**What will I eat?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many up and coming culinary professionals from all over the world are 
making Seattle a destination for launching exciting, new careers. Also 
native Seattlelites are returning to town after launching careers in 
the worlds' food capitals. Your options are vast, generally its hard to
find a bad meal in Seattle. **Caveat** is we're meeting in Seattle's U-District,
on University of Washington's campus. Students view food differently than
the rest of us. Many of the reviews in the U-District may prioritize price
and quantity. 

Don't despair, we're here to help with this Welcome Wagon!


**Where should I sit?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Some seats in the front row are reserved accessibility seating. These will
   be clearly marked. If you have accessibility requirements, feel free to
   take up one of these seats.

-  All other seats are unreserved; feel free to sit anywhere.

-  If you can, show up early to the conference each morning to grab a
   seat inside the theatre. Introducing yourself to your
   neighbors is one of the easiest way to meet people.

**What should I do during the talks?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The time between talks is for meeting your colleagues or taking a
   break. During the talks, listen and take in as much as you can.

-  There is a lot of great information at this conference, but don't
   worry if you miss something! All talks are videotaped, so you can
   review them later.

-  If you have a question during a talk, make a note of it and use it as
   a conversation starter with the speaker.

-  After a talk, feel free to tweet about it with the hashtag
   `#pycascades <https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyCascades?src=hash>`_.
   Try not to "watch" the conference through Twitter and
   other social media, though. You are attending the conference, so live
   in it as much as you can!


**What are lightning talks, and should I give one?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Lightning talks will take place on both main conference days, right
   after lunch, from 1:50PM to 2:20 PM.

-  All lightning talks will be recorded and live streamed. 

-  A lightning talk is a five-minute talk where you quickly share a
   concept or bit of info you find interesting. Slides are not required.

-  Lightning talks are a great way to practice public speaking, get
   people excited about your personal projects, and test interest in
   a conference proposal idea.

-  Do you have an idea, want to talk about a new tool you are learning,
   or review a process? Then, yes! Sign up for a lightning talk. There
   will be a sign-up at registration.

-  PyCascades is aiming to have a a balanced mix of speakers therefore
   we’ll be using two buckets where folks can self-identify their
   speaking experience as ‘new’ or ‘experienced’ to submit. A
   thoughtful title, a sentence blurb, contact info to follow up,
   and notes on if you have slides or not should be included in
   your submission.

-  Lightning talks selection will happen in a relatively tight window
   during the conference. It is important to be responsive, ideally
   through the conference Slack #lightningtalks channel, to ensure
   if you are selected we get your materials and order for the
   speaking line up situated in a timely fashion.

-  If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, be prepared! There
   is a great guide
   `here <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/lightning-talks/>`_.

**How do I make the most out of this conference?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make connections with other first-time attendees and get advice from seasoned
pros.

The most important part of this conference (and any conference) is the
people you meet. Set a goal for yourself to meet a few, new people. Here
are some tips:

-  Find out who is attending the conference before you get there. Join
   the `PyCascades Slack`_, follow
   `PyCascades on Twitter <https://twitter.com/pycascades>`_,
   and review the `list of
   talks <https://www.pycascades.com/talks/>`_.

-  Figure out which companies will be represented at the conference. If
   you see a job post you're interested in, you might want to ask them a
   few questions. This might be a great time to better understand what
   it's like to work at certain companies.

-  Make a list of a few people you would like to meet, and write down
   some questions for them. If you can find contact information, email
   them before the conference and let them know you are looking forward
   to chatting.

-  Most importantly, remember that you don't have to meet everyone. In
   fact, you shouldn't. You should plan to make a few, meaningful
   connections. That is what the PyCascades conference is about, so
   go for it! Introduce yourself.

**Sample strategy for my first PyCascades conference**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Join the `PyCascades Slack`_,
   to start making conference connections.

-  Make a list of two people who are attending with some notes about
   them and questions for them. Either reach out by email before the
   conference to set up a meeting onsite or find them at the conference.

-  Attend the `sprint <sprint.html>`_ and volunteer to help on one of the projects being
   worked on.

-  Check out the talk schedule in advance and make note of the talks you
   don't want to miss.

-  Check out the lightning talks, and get excited about presenting one
   at next year's conference.

**Sample strategy for a second or higher conference**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Reach out to some first-time attendees and tell them about your first
   conference.

-  Attend the `sprint <sprint.html>`_ with your own project. Ask for help!

-  Check out the talk schedule in advance and make note of the talks you
   don't want to miss.

-  Sign up for a lightning talk.
