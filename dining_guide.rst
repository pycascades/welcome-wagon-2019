Around Town (Possible Dinner and Evening)

If you want to venture away from the University of Washington 
you have a few options. Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle can 
be accessed via the light rail and are south of UW. To the west 
of UW there are a few neigborhoods that can be reach via buses,
Wallingford, Fremont, and Ballard. These locations might be hard 
to get there and back for lunch but could be a good place to get 
dinner and/or drinks in the evening.

Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle can be reached by the light 
rail which can be caught at the University of Washington Station 
on Montlake Blvd. This is a 0.6 mile / 1 km walk from Kane Hall. 
There are also buses (48/197/271/542) along 15th Ave which connect 
to the light rail station, this includes <0.3 miles / 0.5 km of walking. 

<Bus directions to neighborhoods>

The transit timetables are integrated into the popular map apps, such as Google Maps.
There is also the One Bus Away app for buses which gives you live updates
as to when the next bus is due at each bus stop.

Seattle is served by taxis as well as rideshare services such as Lyft, Uber and
ReachNow. There are also car-share services such as Car2Go and ReachNow, but
street parking is limited in Capitol Hill and Downtown.
